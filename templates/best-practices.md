## üåü Fundamental Principles

### üí° The Five Pillars of Effective Prompting

1. **Clarity**: Unambiguous instructions and expectations
2. **Context**: Sufficient background information and examples
3. **Constraints**: Clear boundaries and limitations
4. **Completeness**: All necessary information provided
5. **Consistency**: Reliable patterns and formatting

### üèÅ Universal Best Practices

#### ‚úÖ Essential Do's

- **Be Specific and Precise**: Use exact requirements rather than vague descriptions
- **Provide Context**: Include relevant background information and use cases
- **Use Examples**: Show desired output format with concrete examples
- **Set Clear Boundaries**: Define what should and shouldn't be included
- **Specify Output Format**: Clearly indicate desired structure and style
- **Include Success Criteria**: Define how to measure output quality
- **Test Iteratively**: Refine prompts based on actual results

#### ‚ùå Critical Don'ts

- **Avoid Ambiguity**: Don't use unclear or subjective language
- **Don't Overload**: Avoid cramming too many tasks into one prompt
- **Skip Assumptions**: Don't assume the AI knows unstated context
- **Ignore Edge Cases**: Consider unusual scenarios and exceptions
- **Neglect Validation**: Always verify outputs for accuracy and completeness
- **Forget Security**: Be mindful of sensitive data and ethical implications

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Pitfalls

### üöß Frequent Mistakes

**1. Overcomplication**
```
‚ùå Problem: Too many tasks in one prompt
‚úÖ Solution: Break into focused, single-purpose prompts

Bad: "Analyze this code for security, performance, maintainability, and documentation issues, then rewrite it, create tests, and generate deployment scripts."

Good: "Analyze this code for security vulnerabilities and provide specific remediation recommendations."
```

**2. Insufficient Context**
```
‚ùå Problem: Assuming AI knows your specific situation
‚úÖ Solution: Provide comprehensive background information

Bad: "How do I secure this?"

Good: "How do I secure this REST API endpoint that handles payment processing for our e-commerce platform, considering PCI DSS compliance requirements?"
```

**3. Vague Success Criteria**
```
‚ùå Problem: No clear definition of good output
‚úÖ Solution: Specify measurable quality criteria

Bad: "Make it better"

Good: "Improve performance by at least 20% while maintaining 99.9% accuracy and full backward compatibility"
```

**4. Ignoring Model Limitations**
```
‚ùå Problem: Asking for real-time data or capabilities the model doesn't have
‚úÖ Solution: Understand and work within model constraints

Bad: "What's the current stock price of AAPL?"

Good: "Analyze this historical stock data and identify patterns that might indicate future trends"
```

### üîß Debugging Techniques

**When Prompts Don't Work:**

1. **Simplify**: Remove complexity and focus on core task
2. **Clarify**: Add more specific instructions and examples
3. **Constrain**: Add boundaries and limitations
4. **Example**: Provide concrete input/output samples
5. **Iterate**: Make incremental improvements
6. **Validate**: Test with different inputs and scenarios
